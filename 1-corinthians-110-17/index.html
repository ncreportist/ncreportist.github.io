<p>“Many members divided themselves into supporters of one or other of these leaders. Some, however, said they ‘belonged to Christ’. This intriguing group may have been those we encounter later in the letter who prized ‘spiritual gifts’, in particular ‘speaking in other tongues’, which they may have claimed as coming to them from the risen Christ, <strong>setting them apart as an elite group</strong> (see on 4:7-8; 14:6-25, 36-37). It is possible we meet the same faction in the Second Letter as those who declare themselves to ‘belong to Christ’ but question whether Paul does (2 Corinthians 10:7)” [p.143]</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Corinthians 4:7–8</strong> (ESV) For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it? Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!</li>
<li><strong>1 Corinthians 14:6–25</strong> (ESV) Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church. Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue. Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. In the Law it is written, “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</li>
<li><strong>1 Corinthians 14:36–37</strong> (ESV) Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.</li>
<li><strong>2 Corinthians 10:7</strong> Look at what is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ’s, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ’s, so also are we.</li>

<p>“Paul never addresses the factions directly but rather speaks to the entire church.” [p. 105]</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He is speaking to each individual member to examine themselves. This self examination is further encouraged later when addressing the issue of factions at the Lord’s supper.</p></li>
<li>The main point in this passage is that groups are coming up with slogans which distinguish themselves from other believers (including using the name of Christ!).</li>
<li>Paul later proudly states says he is ‘of Christ’ demonstrating this not a phrase Christians should shy from (2 Cor 10:7)</li>
<li>Here he ensuring that the term is not being used as a basis for a division to distinguish themselves themselves from fellow belivers.</li>
<li><p>Aren’t slogans like the Church ‘of God’, the House ‘of God’, ‘of the Lord’, used in the CoG to distinguish ourselves from other believers? Don’t we use these slogans as a demonstration we are set apart as an elite group?</p></li>

<p>“All this ‘I am for this apostle or that’ is rubbish: I am for Christ!”</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the popular alternative view of this verse</li>
<li>A basis for understanding it this way woull be the fact that “1 Corinthians 3:4-5 mentions Paul and Apollos; 3:22 — Paul, Apollos, and Cephas; and 4:6 — Paul and Apollos. In 1:12” and therefor the Christ group does not actually exist.</li>
<li>Another clear point in all of Pauls letters is that in no form does Paul instruct any believer to differentiate themselves from other believers</li>
<li>There is a byproduct of living an approved life, but that isonly revealed by being part of the community where those who are unaproved are gathered with the approved</li>
<li>The ch. 5 isntruction to disassociate was to differentiate from believers living in moral disobedience agaist God which even the pagans of the time would have regected as imoral. Any person who claimed to be a brother and practices these things were not living as a believer.</li>
