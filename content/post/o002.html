<p>Our basis for dissasociation with other denominations is that our Fellowship is</p>
<ul>
<li>of God</li>
<li>of the Son</li>
<li>in the Lord</li>
<li>of Christ</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition, that would mean that there are fellowships out there which are not of God, not in the Lord, not of the Son, not of Christ. The wording of the greek demonstrates that there is only one of these Fellowships.</p>
