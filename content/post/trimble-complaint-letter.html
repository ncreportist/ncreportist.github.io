<p>Initially stated that the reason for the errors was that there was an error with one of the lasers (the light was flashing). It was then stated via a phone call a few eeks later that it wasnâ€™t an issue with the laser, but the fact that the origin point was 700km away. It was claimed that this was due to the tablet beinga 32 device and the laptop being a 64 device. Specialists had produced a modified drawing with the origin moved to the center of the building</p>

<h2>Visit 3 - 10/5/2016</h2>
<p>On the 3rd visit, I provided a clear asbuilt drawing showing where the gridlines were located and the offset direction/distance. We found on site that he had still managed to pick the wrong gridline on the software. This took 30 mins to go back to the office and switch the drawings.</p>
<p>The drawing was swithed with a drawing with the original origin (700km away).</p>
