## About

Add all tips I pick up re: AutoCAD


## Useful keyboard commands

* `eattext` allows the exporting of a csv file without addons
* `qselect` allows selection of all items using filters (e.g. all in a sepcific layer)
* `mleaderstyle` like dimstyle but for multileaders
* `regen` regenerates the page and "un-facates" curves
* `divide` divides a line into equal sections
* `units` to change the decimal place of the properties values
* `align`

* `UCS -> OBject` to align a page view, `plan -> Current` to Center the view
* `borrowlisence` allow offline access to network liscened AutoCAD
* `draworder` move elements to back/move to front
* `pdfclip` crops pdfs
* `osnapz:1` then `chamfer` to join 2 lines which are not inline w/ each other
    * Note: osnapz 
* `ddptype` to change it to scale
* `multiple` then `points` allows for multiple points. paste csv formated E,N,Z and it will add all points (minus the point ID)
* `"right-click and drag"` to move or copy object
* `"select box drag left and right"` have diffenrt functions
* create a `script.src` with commands and data. Ensure there is a return after the last command/data
    * See [script.scr](../data/muliple-pts-script.txt) for example
* `ps` to exit a viewport
* `burst` is an alternative to explode which maintains linked text
* `qnew` create a new document from a template
* `xref`
* If errors with attaching an xref use `purge` and `audit` and try again
* `viewport` will insert a viewport to a paperspace
* `laydel` force deletes a layer
* `pdfimport` 

## General tips

* **Pixilated text when printing to pdf:** increase the paper size
* **Utilise Bluebeam Revu:** update logistics/services drawing on autocad and use Bluebeam to update items which change frequently e.g. walkways
* **Label coords:** http://www.cad-notes.com/how-to-label-coordinate-in-autocad/ OR http://www.cad-notes.com/using-autolisp-to-label-point-coordinate/
* **Set measurement scale to 100**
* **Sheet sets** are used to
    * automatically number and annotate text in title blocks
    * callout blocks and label blocks
    * See http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/acadblog/autocad-tutorial-create-a-simple-sheet-set/ for tutorial

## Numbering points

Use engineering surveyor Import/Export point scripts

* export to a csv with the same name as layer
* ensure you set the starting number the last number used + 1
* Save and import csv as points
    * Find a way to not import duplicate values
