In both of these scriptures the word koinwnia evidently means not the act of having, acting, and suffering in common, nor yet that which is in common possessed; but rather the community of those who are partners together.” (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GGL2U5AW?page=257">p. 508</a>)</p>

<p><em>For instance, the writer states this point which demonstrates this. This is the exact concept expressed by in 1 John 1:3. (note on p.509)</em></p>
