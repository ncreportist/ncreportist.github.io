<p>Needed Truth, 1888** (The first issue)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“we believe there is a considerable range of deeply important subjects, which are not receiving their due share of attention from many” –W.Laing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Taking heed the words of the apostle,”Be ye imitators of me,&quot; we are anxious that a unified testimony, - a divinely-united testimony, - may be borne to such truths as the Spirit of God may be pleased to teach heirin.&quot; –W.Laing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They hoped from the offset that a unifid testemony would be born from these teachings of the magazine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No matter how popular such doctrines may become, or how pleasing they may appear, they originated in the brain of man.” –W.Laing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>–W.Laing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Two Christians were conversing together; One asked the other, ~”What denomination do you belong to?&quot; “To which does the word of God say I should belong t?” was the reply. “Oh! I don’t know that it tells us to belong to any.” “Well, that’s the reason I belong to none.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Independats, Baptists, Dissenters, Methodists, Slavtion Army, etc., etc., are names which exibit the sad specticle of Christendom in its confusion and sinful schism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A Christian” (1 Peter 4:16), “Saints” (1 Cor 1:2), “Brethren” (Heb 2:11) “Believers” (Acts 5:14), are names which God has given His people, and which include all born-again ones.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In Apostolic times they were together as belivers (Acts 2:44), they came together as disciples (Acts 20:7), they were gathered unto the Name (Matt 18:20), they recognised each other as brethren, because they were all children of God. They had no separte”cause&quot; to build up, no distinctive “denomination” to which they belonged, no particular doctrine, by making which a centre they made themselves a “sect”. The Body they belonged to embraced all saved ones within its membership (Rom 12:4,5; 1 Cor 12:13), and the Lord Jesus, as the Head of that Body, was recognised in absolute and exclusive control of it, by the Holy Spirit and the word of Truth. How different in Christendom:now schism…Yet hath God said, “there should be no schism in the body” (1 Cor 12:25),&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as I agree with the issue here of schisms and denominational distinctives, I would disagree witth the NT Brethren’s solution of becoming another schism/sect within Christianity with its own distinctives… This does not fix the problem, this is making the problem worse. There have been similar movements who have attempted to achive the same thing (Church of Christ, Worldwide Church of God, Church of God (LDS)). So we know changing your name to a more biblical sounding name does not fix any problems. It just makes the problem worse.</p>
<p>There are movements which are working together on much more viable solutions to this problem which I will explore in another post. There are movements breaking away from their denominational distinctives, putting emphasis on what makes similar. The church I’ve joined, I sit with ex-exclusive brethren, ex-free church, ex-baptists, ex-open-brethren, ex-church of scotland</p>
<p>‘This people honors me with their lips,
but their heart﻿ is far from me,
and they worship me in vain,
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’
– Matt 15:8-9</p>
<p>they who are obedient thereto the same everywhere and in every company</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if we are in that which claims to be God’s House; and yet the Christian cannot behave himself as these words require, nay, where these words are neither obeyed nor could be, because of the orginisation and its dicta, is it not clear that such is not House of God at all?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here the writer is suggesting that any church who are unable to persuade its members to be obedient to their teaching, cannot be considered a member the house of God</p>
<p>I’d like to challenge this by looking at 2 scenarios. In both scenaries, “Molly” has just joined a new church. In this new church, the teaching is very clear that women must wear a headcovering when praying in church. Molly has grown up to be falsely taught that heading coverings were a cultural issue specifically for the Corinth church and that wedding rings are now the cultural sign of submission. Consider these 2 ways to deal with this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Molly is approached by an elder after the meeting and is instructed that she must wear a head covering when praying in church. Molly is not persuaded that that is the truth but submits regardless.</li>
<li>Molly is not instructed to wear a head covering but when the topic comes up, the teaching is still pro-head covering. Molly is not persuaded by the teaching and continues not to wear a headcovering when praying in church.The church leaders hope Molly will eventually be persuaded but do not enforce the doctrine upon her.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both scenarios, Molly is still not persuaded that head coverings are a biblical doctrine. This is not a case of disobedience to God, but a case of ignorance.
