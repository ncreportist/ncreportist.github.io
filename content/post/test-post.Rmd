This is a test post using blowdown, an implementation of static site generator Hugo which adds extended features, namely Pandoc, which allows me to add citations to my posts like this [@aitken1986]. This implenetation uses .Rmd files rather than .md files

I had previously been using jekyll-scholar but the citation makers were just not pretty and Pandoc is a far superior

The list of tools I'm using to write this post is below:

#### Option 1: set the file name as the slug

**Benefits:** When your linking another post, you can use the slug only for example linking [this post](/bad-faith) i simply use the file name and it will always take me to the link as long as I never change the slug. I can change the title as much as I like and the slug will never change. Good eh? I have some work to do but it's looking good so far.

**Disadvantages:** You can't change the file name in the future. This requires the date in the file name which I may not want if I want to search alphabetically through my posts on my text editor (however this will force me to make sure my website navigation is good)

#### Option 2: Type the slug into the post's yaml. 

**Why this is better:** This method will require me to use the website's tagging to find my previous post on the topic.  It also requires me to find the 

**Disadantages:** I need to go onto the website to find the slug for this post. 

**Workarounds:** A potential workaroud would be to have a script to set the slug to the file name in the yaml header. A bit complicated for me though - would rather just manually maintain it as I go. For referencing other posts, a workflow would be to find the webpage on the browser and check the slug in the address bar. Again, this would make sure my website navigation is good.
