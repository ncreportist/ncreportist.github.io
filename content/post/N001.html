<p><strong>Sermon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colin Adams (Exodus 40)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Singing:</strong> “From The Squaleor Of A Borrowed Stable”</p>
<p><strong>Prayer Team announcement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity for prayer up the front</li>
<li>Prayer team: Ian MacDonald, Nikki Adams</li>
<li>Speak to the person next to share what they they were encouraged by during the sermon or the songs. It may be an encouragement to you and you may have an encouraging word for them</li>
<li>Closing verse</li>
<li>1 Thessalonian 4:9-10</li>
<li>“Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. And in fact, you love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more”</li>
<li>How does he suggest we do this? By encouraging each other with words (v18)</li>
<li>Specifically words that remind each other of the work of Christ, looking forward to the full fulfilment of God’s promises through him when “will meet the Lord in the air” (v17)</li>
<li>It’s also struck me recently me how that God is pleased with being reminded of his promises by his people and especially being reminded of his Son. If god seeks reminders, how much more might we benifit from being reminded.</li>
<li>Glorify God</li>

<p><strong>Closing Benediction / Prayer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open up to the congregation</li>
