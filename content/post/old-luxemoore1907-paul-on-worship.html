<p>This article outlines ‘Needed Truth’ thinking on worship. It also gives insight into why many open-brethren only address the Father in worship. Exclusives address the Father and the Son, J. Taylor’s followers also address the Spirit directly.</p>

<p>About the Author: One of the key figures of a conservative, exclusive strand of the open-brethren, the Chrurches of God (aka. Needed Truth Brethren). He lead the fight agaist the leader of the Frank Vernal strand of the Needed Truth. He also was the collator of the Churches of God hymn book, “Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs”, which is still used today with minor revisions. The hymn book still maintains the principles laid out below.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p>The idea of worship further includes the doing of a series of things that shall be well-pleasing to God and accepted by Him as an expression of the loyal homage of the worshipper. The is often expressed in the English Bible by the words “serve” and “service.” But it is not a matter of service in the ordinary sense. In their translation of Hebrew 12:28 the 1880 Revisers very happily express the thought by the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not so much the doing of the thing itself - it is the offering of this action to God. However, as we do not propose in the present articles to follow Paul’s teaching in his anonymous letter to the Hebrews, we are content to leave this most important passage of Hebrews 12:28, notwithstanding its present value, after merely citing it as a happy rendering of the thought conveyed by the Greek verb letreuo, I offer service to God.</p>
<p>Before going further, we direct attention to the use of this same word as cited by the Lord Jesus in His reply to the tempter (see Matthew 4:10; Luke 4:8).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is written: -
“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, And Him only shalt thou serve.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, we have here a word describing such service as may only be offered to God Himself.</p>
<p>In what we have previously written as to worship expressing itself in a certain attitude of mind and body, these are brought about almost involuntarily, one mat say, as a result of the apprehension of who and what God is. Consequently they are equally in place, whether we are speaking of the Father or of the Son. This, for example, in Luke 5:8, and in Revelation 1:17, the intelligent sight of the Lord Jesus Christ prostrates before Him, Peter in the one case, John in the other, and this as truly when the Lord was in the humble guise of the days of His humiliation, as when His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.</p>
<p>But we shall search in vain for any illustration of service being offered to the Lord Jesus Christ in the sense of the words -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Him only shalt thou serve.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For it is His special work to direct and control the offering of such service to His God and His Father.</p>
<p>We repeat, the true Divinity and transcendent greatness of the Lord Jesus Christ demand our prostration before Him, but the service which is the outcome and expression of worship is only to be offered to the Father.</p>
<p>Amongst the uses by Paul, in the letters to which he puts his name, of the Greek words latreuo, I offer service, and letreia, service (religious service, worship), we shall first note the one in Romans 1:25, a verse previously referred to (p. 11) telling of degenerate idolators who -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was no marvel that such men needed to be told that Creator had no need of anything, as their and idols had. He has no need of service (a different word altogether is used in Acts 17:25). He has no lack that men can supply. Compare the sad plight of Dagon (1 Samuel 5:3-5):-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; But Jehovah made the heavens.” (1 Chronicles 16:26, RV Margin)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be remembered that in the offering of service to God mistakes, ay, fatal mistakes, may be made. Paul could truthfully say: -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience,” (2 Tim 1:3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what about acceptance of the service that he offered to God? What Sail laid waste the church, and persecuted it even unto strange cities (Acts 9:1), he thought that he was offering service to God (see the words of the Lord Jesus in John 16:2, doxe latreian prospherein to Theo, he will think to present service to God). We are sure that no service of his was acceptable, however well meaning and zealous he was, till he had fallen to the earth and bowed his knee, confessing “Jesus Christ is Lord.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There after he says: -
​ “God, …whom I serve
​ in my spirit
​ in the gospel of His Son.” (Rom 1:19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thought here is something done as an expression of worship of God. It is not here fellowship with God in His love of the world. Far less is it the gospel as something for the sinner. It is God to whom he offers service as he goes forth heralding the gospel.</p>
<p>It is the continuance of what he first expressed in the Damascus road</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What shall I do lord?” Acts 22:11</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And He who, sitting by Sychar’s well, had told the Samaritan woman there of the Father’s search for worshippers, brings this Saul to God; and then sends him forth with the pregnant words upon his lips (true expression of his heart’s thoughts) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The God Whose I am, Whom also I serve,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which we find in Acts 27:23. This is not now the deluded service of the one exceeding mad against God’s new people, but the service offered to God according to the instruction and command of Him who knows God and knows God’s heart’s desire.</p>
<p>The manner of this service the Jews called a sect (as see Acts 24:14) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But this I confess unto thee that after the Way which they call a Sect, so serve I the God of our fathers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we have cited four passages in which Paul speaks of himself as offering to God that service which is really a part of worship - a kind of service only due to God. At first indeed, unregenerate, he served God unacceptably, persecuting in His members the Lord of Life and Glory, even as he fully acknowledged (Acts 26:7) the twelve tribes to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Earnestly serving God night and day”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when the One who alone knew what was pleasing to God had met him, and made him a disciple, none more earnestly than he preached the Faith of which he once made havoc, and he expresses the root cause of all this: -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whose I am, whom also I serve”;
“After the Way which they call a sect so serve I the God of our fathers.”
“Whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What weight is this given to the soul stirring words of Romans 12:1 RV margin!-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, To present your bodies a living scarifice, Holy, Acceptable to God. Which is your reasonable service,
And be not fashioned according to this world;
But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,
That ye may prove what is the will of God,
the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus may we, like Paul, offer to God acceptable service as the expression of the adoration of our hearts. While, as he writes in Romans 9:4, the service as the expression of the adoration of our hearts. While, as he writes in Romans 9:4, the service of God pertained to the Israelites in a day now past, and shall also indeed in a day yet to come, nevertheless it is not only they who can offer service well-pleasing to God. But if we would do so we must avoid their faults (see Amos 5:25-27). We must not bring ourselves into likeness or allow ourselves to be brought into likeness with the fashion of this world. We may use the world: we may not use ut to the full. It is impossible to present our bodies to God as an acceptable expression of our worship if we conform ourselves to the world’s fashions and neglect that transformation which the renewing of our mind alone can effect.</p>
<p><em>End of Chapter 3</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> The hymns must be addressed to God the Father; either expressly, or else there should, at least, be nothing in their wording inconsistent with the direct address to Him. All hymns of mere meditation are out of place as are all dorect addresses to the Lord Jesus Christ (see the passage from Colossians already mentioned). The mention of the Name of the Lord in that way of apostrophe as in the verse,</p>
<p>“ ‘Man of sorrows,’ what a Name
For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim.
Hallelujah! What a Saviour! ”</p>
<p>Is by no means to be objected to if it is abundantly clear the hymn is not addressed to Him.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> God is to be addressed as the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ; He is also our God and our Father, but when engaged in priestly service, though we may rightly address Him as our God, it is out of place to speak to Him as Father or our Father, for the relationship of Father which He bears to us is altogether different from that in which we approach Him as worshippers.</p>
<p>Rule 3 In the adoration or heart-worship of which the hymns are an expression we are to recollect the equality and co-eternity of Father and Son and Spirit, and thus we adore one God in Three Persons and Three Persons in one God, but our adoration is offered in the Spirit through the Son unto the Father.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4</strong> The leading subject of all Spirit-taught worship is the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. His incarnation, His life, His humiliation, His atoning death, His glorious resurrection, His present exaltation, His future reign; but above all, His personal excellencies. Round this theme all others must revolve. The goodness and greatness of God otherwise expressed at have a place. Some hymns will be like the Divine-taught “Hallelujah,” an utterance od praise with little or no expression of why their praise is given, an utterance called forth by what has f=gone before or what is in the minds of all, as in the various doxologies such as:</p>
<p>“Praise God from whome all blessings flow,
Praise Him His people here below,
Praise Him His people here below,
Praise Him above ye heavenly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule 5</strong> Any refernce to ourselves, our needs, our experience, will have a small place. In proportion to our true appreciation of the Lord Jesus Christ and the infinite satisfaction He gives the Father will be the degree in which we lise sight of ourselves and one another when together for the remeberance of the Lord Jesus Christ in the breaking of the load and that which goes therewith.</p>
