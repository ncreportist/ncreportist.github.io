## Version control

* **Option 1:** For Office documents, maintain an office file with tag "_MASTER". E.g, "DocName_MASTER.xsl". When releasing a document, save-as PDF and tag with "_yymmdd" (e.g. DocName_160501.pdf)

This ensures that there is a "one version of the truth" version (the office document) as well as snapshot revisions. If updating a file more than once in a day (rare), use the format "_160501a, _160501a etc".

* **Option 2:** For files where it isn't suitable for converting to PDFs (e.g. DWG or RVT), use the following rules
	1. Use revision numbers instead of dates e.g. "DrawingName_00.dwg" where _00 is the revision number
	1. When sending out a new revision, save-as a new revision number before sending
	1. After sending, make any modifications to the current revision
* **Option 3:** For paper files (handwritten markups etc.), keep all items stored in a tabbed physical folder and email out snapshots. Do not keep a copy. This ensures the document in the folder is the single version of the truth. Optional: Use a blank A3/A4 cover page for writing related notes

Note:Some situations requre both such as logistics drawings which contain services

## File naming

* for a title, use "CamelCase.ext" , "seperate by spaces.ext" "or_underscores.ext"
* use-scores-for-version-number-or-hierarachy.ext
* use_underscores_for_and.ext
* Use folders
	* Company
	* Project
* If going to an external client, begin with the client's name. E.g. ClientName-Tracker160606-03-grayscale.pdf
* Add notes with a score-like_this.ext
* For revision numbering, use numbers and for small changes (e.g. comments from client), use an additional letters e.g.
	* ClientName-Tracker160606-03-grayscale.pdf
	* ClientName-Tracker160606-03a-grayscale.pdf
	* ClientName-Tracker160606-03b-grayscale.pdf
* Use a date on the publication its self so it can be printed
* If the file has a totally different redesign, use V2 at the end of the title e.g.
	* ClientName-Tracker160606V2-03-grayscale.pdf
* When including a personal name give the family name first followed by initials with no comma in between.
* For
numbers 0-9, always use two digit numbers to ensure numerical order – (01, 02, 03 etc.)
* The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘V’ followed by the version number (eg V01, V03 etc.) and where applicable ‘draft.’

see [pdf](../data/naming-conventions.pdf) for more

## Folder naming

* Use months as folder names e.g. `01_JAN , 02_FEB , 03_MAR etc.` 

## Tips from online source

Characters to Avoid in Directories and Filenames

Your web files will be viewed by numerous users who use a wide variety of operating systems (Mac, PC, and Linux for instance) and devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones are some examples). Therefore, it is essential to play it safe and avoid common illegal directory and filename characters.

Naming conventions are important in web folders as well as for downloadable files such as PDFS, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets.

Do not use any of these common illegal characters/symbols:

`#` pound 	`<` left angle bracket 	`$` dollar sign 	`+` plus sign
`%` percent 	`>` right angle bracket 	`!` exclamation point 	\` backtick
`&` ampersand 	`*` asterisk 	`‘` single quotes 	`|` pipe
`{` left bracket 	`?` question mark 	`“` double quotes 	`=` equal sign
`}` right bracket 	`/` forward slash 	`:` colon 	 
`\ ` back slash 	blank spaces 	`@` at sign

Also, keep these rules in mind:

* Don’t start or end your filename with a space, period, hyphen, or underline.
* Keep your filenames to a reasonable length and be sure they are under 31 characters
* Most operating systems are case sensitive; always use lowercase
* Avoid using spaces and underscores; use a hyphen instead.

Bad filenames:

	F&A Costs.html
	my PDF file#name.pdf

Web Browsers see:

	F&amp;A%20Costs.html
	my%20PDF%20file%23name.pdf

Good filenames:

	index.html
	my-pdf-file-name.pdf

Note: This list is not exhaustive. It is meant to help you avoid common errors in filenames.

`yymmdd_n` solves the issue of multiple folders/files created on same date

- upto 50 characters long to avoid problems saving/copying etc
- Avoid in,at,so,in,and etc
- No spaces
- dates start with 2016 not 16

V0.1	First draft
V0.2	Second draft
V1.0	Final approved version
V1.1	Minor revision
V2.0	Major revision

e.g. 20120216CCVUsageReportV0.1.docx

## Directory structure

**Saving files:**

Tip: Keep the folder your working on open and copy paste the file path when saving to PDF

Copy paste

![](../images/file-path.png)

Keeping the folder open allows you to

* use explorer functions like right click "open in"
* explore the folder and easily hyperlink files

## Setting-out markups

* Mailing
	- Use BMCE-GC-011615 for both ENV and INT markups
	- Create a folder named "BMCE-GC-011615"
	- CC: Aconex Group "Setting out mailing list"
	- To: Thomas Norrie
* File naming convention
	- [ENV/EXT/GRID/SET/INT]-[Level]-[Zone/Area]-[Details](optional)-[Date setout]
	- e.g ENV-L3-CYD-NFace Grid 160823
* Document managment
	- move to sent folder after sending 

## Site Stations

* `M1001` where:
	- M: Multiplex
	- 1: Level
	- 001: Sequential number

Note: For projects over 10 storeys, use 01 for Level

* Use `M1001D` for additional stations set by others
	- e.g. D: Dunne OR S: Snedden

## CAD Directory Structure

* CAD
	- data: Any data that I use/edit for data that is not a xref
	- xrefs
	- src: All source files sent from client/desgner/contractor w/ YYMMMDD - Senders Name - Description
		+ Never modify or link to files in this folder. If Using a file, copy it to the data folder.
* PRODUCTION

http://cadintentions.com/folders/

See below for a potentially better version of naming conventions. This makes use of Sheets and ALL information is an xref. This will be good to practice.
