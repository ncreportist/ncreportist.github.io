## Leica prisms review

Aim:

To determine the accurancy of the various leica prisms.

![](../images/leica-prisms.png)

Findings:

* GMR111 is the most accurate and produces conststant readings with avarage varience of 0mm
* The pogo staff is least accurate. Average varience is 1-2mm
* The mini prism is similar in accurancy to the pole. However, the consitancy is far far higher

Conclusion:

* Continue to use the 360 prism with the mini pogo as it is consistant and relatively accurate for my needs. It also holds a lock to the total station far better.
* Avoid using the staff pogo due to inconsistancies in the readings. If required, use but be careful
