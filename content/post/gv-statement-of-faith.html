<p><strong>1. In the divine inspiration, authority and sufficiency of the Bible</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. That God exists eternally in three persons – Father, Son and Holy Spirit to whom equal honour is due</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. That Jesus Christ, unique Son of God, became man, being begotten of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. That he died for our sins, was buried and rose again for our justification</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. That he ascended to the right hand of God and is now the all-sufficient High Priest of His people</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. That he personally will return to receive his people and judge the world in righteousness</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. That man has fallen and needs the Holy Spirit’s work in regeneration and sanctification</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. That man may be restored to repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. That at death the soul of man does not cease to exist or become unconscious</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. That the dead will be raised either to life or condemnation and that the blessedness of the righteous and the punishment of the unrighteous will, alike, be eternal</strong></p>
