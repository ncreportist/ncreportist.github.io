Setting out

## Curve-setting out


## Sending out sketches

* Mailing
	- Use BMCE-GC-011615 for both ENV and INT markups
	- CC: Aconex Group "Setting out mailing list"
	- To: Thomas Norrie
* File naming convention
	- [ENV or INT]-[Level]-[Zone/Area] [Details] [Date setout]
	- e.g ENV-L3-CYD-NFace Grid 160823
* Document managment
	- move to sent folder after Sending


## Working/Control job naming

Note: Leica Jobs have a 16 MAX characters limit

* Option 1
	* Use 5 characters MAX for Working Job. Add the date for the working job.
		* e.g. `INTL3-161110` ,  `INTL03-161110_01` where "INT" is the job, "L03" is the level/zone, "161110" is the date
	* OR Use 7 characters MAX for Control Job. Add the date for the working job.
		* e.g. EXTL201-20161110 (where "01" is sequential number)
		* This would be my preference

## Ideas to implement

* Use code for point description
	* e.g. "OS400" (for offset 400mm), "OS1m" (offset of 1 meter)
