<p>This is a test post using blowdown, an implementation of static site generator Hugo which adds extended features, namely Pandoc, which allows me to add citations to my posts like this <span class="citation">(aitken et al. 1986)</span>. This implenetation uses .Rmd files rather than .md files</p>
<p>I had previously been using jekyll-scholar but the citation makers were just not pretty and Pandoc is a far superior</p>
<p>Some futher reading:</p>

<p>The list of tools I’m using to write this post is below:</p>

<div id="option-1-set-the-file-name-as-the-slug" class="section level4">
<h4>Option 1: set the file name as the slug</h4>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> When your linking another post, you can use the slug only for example linking <a href="/bad-faith">this post</a> i simply use the file name and it will always take me to the link as long as I never change the slug. I can change the title as much as I like and the slug will never change. Good eh? I have some work to do but it’s looking good so far.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> You can’t change the file name in the future. This requires the date in the file name which I may not want if I want to search alphabetically through my posts on my text editor (however this will force me to make sure my website navigation is good)</p>
</div>
<div id="option-2-type-the-slug-into-the-posts-yaml." class="section level4">
<h4>Option 2: Type the slug into the post’s yaml.</h4>
<p><strong>Why this is better:</strong> This method will require me to use the website’s tagging to find my previous post on the topic. It also requires me to find the</p>
<p><strong>Disadantages:</strong> I need to go onto the website to find the slug for this post.</p>
<p><strong>Workarounds:</strong> A potential workaroud would be to have a script to set the slug to the file name in the yaml header. A bit complicated for me though - would rather just manually maintain it as I go. For referencing other posts, a workflow would be to find the webpage on the browser and check the slug in the address bar. Again, this would make sure my website navigation is good.</p>
