<h2>Exodus 19:1-13; 20:1-17</h2>
<div id="section" class="section level3">
<h3>19:1-13</h3>
<p><strong>What does this passage teach us about God?</strong></p>
<p>.(v10-11) It takes 2 days of concecretion for us to even see God. Even then, he will come conceiled in a thick cloud.</p>
<p>.(v12) Touching where is presence was would lead to instant death. Even at Israel’s most consecrated state, they were not holy enough to touch the ground he stood in</p>
<p><strong>How should we relate to such a God?</strong></p>
<p>.Through a worthy mediator. Moses was a good mediator for Israel. Jesus is better</p>
<p><strong>What does he promise to do in the future?</strong></p>
<p>.Provide a mediator (a king)</p>

<p><strong>Why should we want to obey the Ten Commandments as Christians?</strong></p>

<div id="samuel-71-17" class="section level2">
<h2>2 Samuel 7:1-17</h2>
<p><strong>What does David want to build (verses 1-2)?</strong></p>
<p>. <em>He want’s to build a house made of cedar for the LORD to dwell</em></p>
<p><strong>But what does God want to build (verse 11)?</strong></p>
<p>. <em>(v5) “Would you build me a house to dwell in?” The question expects a negative answer. (V7) The LORD has never asked for a house of cedar.</em></p>
<p>.<em>(v11) The LORD will make a house</em></p>
<p><strong>How does Jesus fulfil these promises? (See Matthew 1:1; John 2:18-22; Acts 2:24-36)</strong></p>
<p>.<em>He is “Son of David” (Matt 1:1), who had raised up the temple (his body) (Jn2:21),</em></p>
<p>.<em>and was exalted at the right hand of God (Acts 2:33),</em></p>
