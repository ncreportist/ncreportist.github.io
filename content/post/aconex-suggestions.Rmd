Fix issues with Favourites
---

The Aconex iPad app is great, however the favorites feature is lacking user friendliness. I have about 1700 favourites, so that while out on Site, i am not using up unecesssary bandwidth re-downloading documents.
I suggest an update to the app with the following changes and bug fixes:

1. When pressing update, an error occurs: "The network connection was lost". This only happens when updating more than 50 documents. NB the ipad is running off Wifi when updating documents. If i select less than about 50 documents, and press update, i dont get this error.
2. When I am in my favorites, and i press Documents, it crashes for about 20 seconds, until finally the Documents search page loads.
3. There is no Select All in Favourites, like in the Documents module. If i want to delete all of my Favourites (to start again to update everything, due to point 1 above), this is a very tedious process (i have about 1700 documents favourited).
4. After doing an update (only works on less than 50 or so documents), i can see a download bar under the document name, but it won't show the download process, like its stalled. Would be good if you can see how the update process is going, and whether it's complete, or underway. For a good example, refer to Spotify app, and how it updates its music when the user requests for it to be synced with the server.

When pasting an image into a mail there is an issue if the image is larger than the witdth of the viewport the image is cropped out of the screen. My suggestion would be to

*automatically resize the width to the width of the view poirt when pasting the image.
