      <description>The estimated size of the city of Jerusalam (circa 30ad) is around is around 1.5km2. You could walk the length of Jerusalem in 10-15 mins. As a comparrison, Gilbralter has a 4 times larger geographical area (6.5km2) and it takes about 1 hour to walk itâ€™s length. This is a significant size difference from cities/towns of today. A medium sized city of today, for instance Manchester, would take around 4 hours to walk from one side to the other.</description>
