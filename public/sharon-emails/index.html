      <p>Was interested to hear about your own journey and would like to hear more about where you are at with things. A few things we talked about:</p>
<p><strong>Head coverings:</strong> The “evangelical” movements tendency to not enforce head coverings when women are praying. How important do you find this point in the scheme of things? Is this a non-negotiable? or would put the issue to the side if you found a movenment which is growing in love, compassion and has a vision which aligns with your own? My first instinct would be to think if they have compromised such a clear and simple teaching, then what else have they compromised… bur I’m carefully entertaining the idea that it’s a non-essential as long as the intention it serves is enforced (the husband is head of his wife). “Evangelical” churches firmly hold a <a href="https://fiec.org.uk/resources/article/women-in-ministry-statement">complimentarianism</a> position through rejecting the cultural relativity argument and strongly enforcing the man being head in a marriage and in church ministry. I can’t speak for the one you attended near home, but if its part of the FIEC network of <a href="https://fiec.org.uk/churches/results?keywords=&amp;radius=10">churches</a> then it likely has a strong bible scriptural/gospel basis.</p>
<p><strong>Shake of faith:</strong> Having a shake of faith while questioning the understandings of the “one true church” (similar to Chris, Jonny, Robert…). Have you ever experienced similar? Where are you now with it now? What have you struggled with in particular?</p>
<p><strong>No youth to serve:</strong> Was sorry to hear your kids have grown up and have not had an interest in taking church things further. Do you have another outlet to serve others in your christian life? A friend suggested a good set up is the 1,2,3 rule where you have 1 mentor, 2 peers and 3 mentees. the mentor and your peers you are fed by and your peers and your mentees you feed. This keep a 5-3 ratio which means you feed more than you get fed. I suppose the nature of your job would provide a lot of outlets for that.</p>
<p>It was difficult to determine what you disagreed with as you are always very patient with me and my rants but would love to discuss anything else on your mind. Have really appreciated having some christlike mentors and peers to learn from recently and there is always room for one more!</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed reply, been a bit manic since i got back but finally finished my to do list and bank holiday jobs so thought i’d carve out a little time to reply.</p>
<p>I enjoyed our chats too. As i said whilst walking it is refreshing and stimulating to be able to talk to other’s about our faith and beliefs we hold. Just in case you feel you didn’t listen i felt you did where i gave you a chance without asking lots of questions that made you talk instead! I am a bit prone to asking questions rather than talking at times.</p>
<p>With regards to your topic list;</p>
<p><strong>Head Coverings:</strong> With regards to this it is always a difficult topic. Clearly the intention around head coverings is about submission to relevant others, from God down to man then women. I would say this isn’t just related to marriage (sure that you didn’t only mean that when you said the husband is the head of the wife as you later refer also to male role in church ministry but just in case) but more of a role of men and women thing more widely. As a single women i should still submit to my male counterparts in their authority and also me being the glory of man is not about being married either. I to agree that it is right to reject the cultural relativity argument and the presence of the angels in v 10 of 1 Cor 11 really hammers that home for me even more. This would also say to me that as angels still exist and that hasn’t changed neither has the covering on head teachings being an outward sign of my inward submission and a right thing to do. Paul clearly says there is no other practice in the churches of God so also doesn’t limit the practice to Corinth or that time particularly that i can see. However, it is very difficult to say that someone’s intention and heart is not important. We know God looks at the heart and i’m sure a women who wears a hat but has many things wrong in her heart might be worse than the other way around. However, I would wonder why a women who agrees that the intention of wearing head coverings is to signify submission would not wear a hat as its not a painful thing to have to do; its a very simple outward sign for the inward submission in a church context. Furthermore, if i compare it to other areas e.g. baptism, that is also an outward symbol of intention to follow Christ and i would see that as as essential step of a disciple and would likewise urge a believer who had the intent to follow him to demonstrate it with the step Christ commanded rather than just hold the intent without the action that follows this and shows it outwardly to others. I don’t think either of them would signify someone wasn’t saved or be part of a bigger issues in that sense, only God will be able to judge at the end for some things what was the right thing and this may be one of those areas. However, i would question why any female wouldn’t do this if they recognize it is an appropriate sign of submission.</p>
<ul>
<li>I specifically used the husband/wife phrase as I don’t see clear evidence that all men are the head of all women. Ephesians 5 makes it clear that a husband is head of the wife, but historically, there was no head over a divorced or widowed women (I would extend to any women not under the roof of their father’s house too). ESV renders it “head of a wife is her husband”. Later it say’s women reflects man’s glory. Do all women reflect all men’s glory? Or Just the wife of the husband. Do you reflect my glory? I think this is a directs relation to the Eph 5 teaching</li>
<li>Why do you believe this is refering to all men being head of all women? Isn’t this the same teaching as ephesians 5? I watched a great teaching on this and how it tied in with rebecca and isaac in Gen 24 when she put on her head covering when she saw him in the distance as a sign of submission to her husband. Also went into the teaching in numbers on vows. If a married women made a vow, the husband could nullify or intercede the vow. Same goes with young woman is under her father’s house. However if you a are a widow or divorcee then you have no such head-covering and are under oth to fulfil the vow as man was. I believe these contexts can be applied when interpreting 1 Cor 11.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shake of faith:</strong> What you said about this was really interesting and struck me quite a lot, in fact i was very thankful for God using you to speak about this. There have been times over the last few years where I’ve definitely struggled more with my faith than i have in my earlier years. I had put it down to a variety of issues including life circumstances. me not putting as much time into personal study and prayer etc. However, it gave me a jolt when you talked about the struggles people have who belong to a “one true” church/religion and then have issues with that . I wondered whether that had contributed more to some of my issues over the last few years than i would have realised without you saying this. I think its definitely been difficult in the church over the last few years too, especially when comparing the church to others e.g. seeing how small the church is, that it isn’t growing/developing people like i would hope, seeing issues with the way some things are run (lack of study, difficulties placing the roles of other churches etc), seeming lack of first love and enthusiasm amongst the church etc. If i’m honest there have been times over the last few years where I have questioned all that i have learnt, not just about churches of God but more widely to even the existence of God itself. I haven’t walked away or felt unable to continue my faith but it’s been tough at times and i certainly drifted farther and had more apathy towards God and his things than i feel i would like to admit. I think this is something any christian can go through, having read other interesting articles about this by an individual outside of Churches of God. However, I very much identified with some of the issues you raised around feeling you couldn’t advocate for people to come to the church and how sad it is to be in that position. As i said i had even visited other churches with the intention of exploring what was out there and to actually get some teaching locally. At the moment i’m still in a place where i feel i have responsibilities and commitments to the local churches and don’t feel that God wants me to be somewhere else. I have a burden to try and help things change/be different and recognise a large part of that is for me to concentrate on being more devoted to my own study and prayer times, meeting with other christians for study etc. I’m not saying i think the Churches of God are the only ones out there which God is pleased with and i never have felt that, however, i do feel its the place God wants me to be right now.</p>
<p><strong>No youth to serve:</strong> It has been very sad to not have enough youngsters in Cardiff to run a decent youth group/any activities. However, i have been praying for direction about this for some time and this week had two invites from other local assemblies to join their youth work. One of these is a work which the young person in Cardiff could go to most weeks and attend and is being set up as a new venture with few staff so i feel that is an answer to that prayer at this time. It not only involves the young person from Cardiff but a few mid-teens from that assembly that i’ve been trying to encourage more recently. It’s funny what you said about mentors and mentees as we have been studying Titus recently as a district and talked about this in relation to Titus 2 and thinking about our role in each other’s lives in terms of mentoring and guidance. I think the churches here have really missed a trick with not encouraging this more, either formally or informally. I think it has happened at times but it’s not been common practice from my experience in recent years, especially for women. I wish i’d had more of a mentor at times and am trying to access more peer supporter and be more of a mentor to younger ones too. Perhaps its just my own fault for not reaching out to an older women but at times (perhaps very wrongly) i’ve also felt there isn’t an older women who would be able to take up that role. I’d be interested to hear how your own experiences have worked in this way and whether you’ve always had to seek out mentors yourself or whether people have informally ended up being in that role? In this sense its good to have someone who is enthusiastic and happy to talk about faith related things and that is why it was good to talk with you on and walk and follow up here. I wasn’t sure what you meant with regards to my job? There are no other christians in my</p>
<p>I apologise if that’s all a bit of a ramble but it’s late-ish and im rushing to reply as it’s a busy week at work, i have things on most evenings and somehow have to pack for a week in Tenerife with my family, which i leave for on Friday. I’m also still on call which i have been over the weekend and just had a call from some carers i need to write up tonight before i get to bed. However, I hope i managed to convey some of my thoughts clearly enough for you to follow and would be interested if you had any responses to them. Also, i’d be interested to hear how your addition to and first week at Greenview went. You seemed so excited about it, i hope it all went well! Hope the new job is going ok so far too!</p>
