      <description>Exclusive Brethren dronsfield1993 The only way a division is possible amongst Open Brethren is for a group of meetings to forsake independency and separate from those who practise it…independents profess not to recognise groups or circles of meetings. (p. 6)

      <description>Exodus 19:1-13; 20:1-17 19:1-13 What does this passage teach us about God?
.(v10-11) It takes 2 days of concecretion for us to even see God. Even then, he will come conceiled in a thick cloud.
.(v12) Touching where is presence was would lead to instant death. Even at Israel’s most consecrated state, they were not holy enough to touch the ground he stood in
How should we relate to such a God?</description>
