<p>“Needed Truth Brethren were told that they must not address the Lord Jesus in worship, as worship had to be addressed only to the Father. This rule is still enforced amongst them and must be regarded as a grave departure from God’s will”that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.&quot; (John 5:23).&quot; (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=7">p. 7</a>)</p>
<p>“Because of the great increase in the numbers of meetings, further light was being sought as to the Scriptural principles in the practical administration of the assembly. It was observed - firstly it is believed by G.V. Wigram -that Scripture always speaks of the church (singular) of a town regardless of the number of gatherings in it, but the churches (plural) of a province or country. From this it was inferred that the local church of a town consisted of all the true Christians in that town, and were to be regarded as the local gathering for the purposes of administration. The different sects and systems made this impossible, but those gathered out of these systems must obey the true scriptural principles for” (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=7">p. 7</a>)</p>
<p>“themselves, and act as the whole local church would have acted if failure had not come in. So it was put into practice that all meetings in one town were to regard themselves as a single unit for purposes of reception, discipline and other administration.” (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=8">p. 8</a>)</p>

<li><em>Towns in the New Testament were a fraction of the size of cities/towns today. The largest town described as a singular ‘church’ was Jerusalem at around 1.5 sqkm. Rome was much larger, but the church was referred to as the church who meet in [person’s home]. Suggesting that the whole city would be considered a singular church would be un-wise. (note on p.8)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>“Now this, no doubt, was based on true scriptural precedent, but they did not take account of the vast difference between the ancient towns and cities in the Scriptures and the conurbations and giant towns of today. A lot or argument and difference of opinion developed as to the practical problems relating to the meetings in the huge town of London. In New Testament times, cities were small enough for a man to walk from one end to the other in 10 to 15 minutes, while between the cities there was such poor transport that a visit to the neighbouring town would take a lot of travelling time. It was quite natural, therefore, that the Christians in a single town would consult together on everything, regardless of the fact that they may have met in different houses for the study of the Apostles’ doctrine and fellowship breaking of bread and prayers.” (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=8">p. 8</a>)</p>

<li>Jerusalem was by far the largest city which is is refered to as a singular entity “church of God” and covered an area of no more than 1.5sqKm (half the size of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a>).</li>

<li>A further arguement is how he addresses the gatherings in his letter to the christians in Rome. Rome at the time of pauls letter was up to 13sqKm</li>

<p><strong>Romans 1:7</strong> To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rome, after Jerusalem, is by far the largest city described in the New Testement.</li>
<li>Interestingly, Paul, rather than being true to form addressing the christians in Rome as the singular entity “church of God in Rome”, he addresses his letter to “all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints” (Rom 1:7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Romans 16:5</strong> Greet also the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in Asia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Further to this, he later address “the church” (singular) which meet in Prisca and Aquila’s house (Rom 16:5)</li>
<li>If we were to guess either way</li>
<li><p>But what we do know is that refering to a whole city of today as a singular entity with out considering the size of the city would be making assumptions.</p></li>
<li>There was communication between churches so there must be some form of line of communication between companies of believers.</li>
<li>The Churches of God would define the geographical boundries of the local sphere inline as defined by the town/city council</li>
<li>It seems like an important consideration to address when the churches first started teaching this.</li>

<p>“J.N.Darby, by then aged and greatly revered, was very keen that the church in London should regard itself as one unit, although he advocated that the meetings in outlying districts such as Croydon, which were not in the geographical boundaries of London, should be pruned off. He said that they had been allowed in the”parent body&quot; while they were small and new, but should now become churches in their own right. He seemed to regard any attack on the conception of one local church in London as advocating independent churches. It is not clear why he thought so. Could not the single unit have been the church in a borough?&quot; (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=8">p. 8</a>)</p>
<p>“The outcome of all this was that brethren representative of some 26 London meetings used to meet regularly on Saturday nights in a room at London Bridge and later at 145 Cheapside. These meetings were meant to be channels of communication only. As they were not the local church, but only representative brethren, they were not expected to bind or loose anything but merely to pass on and receive information to and from their respective gatherings. But they soon began to recommend decisions, even if they could not ratify them, and in practice a decision taken at Cheapside would be accepted without question, especially on minor details.” (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=8">p. 8</a>)</p>
<p>“Also the Park St. meeting at Islington, being the most central of the gatherings and containing a good number of the most influential brethren, began to acquire an unrecognized and unofficial power and authority. There was a monthly brothers’ meeting at Park St. for all the London meetings, where all important administrative decision s were made. It was the seed of an ecclesiastical hierarchy that would become full-grown one day. We shall see how it developed as we continue our history.” (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KJ47SS7D?page=8">p. 8</a>)</p>
