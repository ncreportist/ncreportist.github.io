  abstract = {Daniel's story is one of extraordinary faith in God lived out at the pinnacle of executive power. It tells of four teenage friends, born in the tiny state of Judah about 26 centuries ago, but captured by Nebuchadnezzar, emperor of Babylon. Daniel describes how they eventually rose to the top echelons of administration.          Daniel and his friends did not simply maintain their private devotion to God; they maintained a high-profile witness in a pluralistic society antagonistic to their faith. That is why their story has such a powerful message for us. Society tolerates the practice of Christianity in private and in church services, but it increasingly deprecates public witness.      If Daniel and his compatriots were with us today they would be in the vanguard of the public debate. What it was that gave that ancient foursome, Daniel and his three friends, the strength and conviction to be prepared, often at great risk, to swim against the flow?},

"\`iGroves has just been telling me, that it appeared to him from Scripture, that believers, meeting together as disciples of Christ were free to break bread together, as their Lord had admonished them; and that, in as far as the practice of the apostles could be a guide, every Lord\'is Day should be set apart for thus remembering the Lord\'is death, and obeying his parting command\^i."

"Under Darby\'is influence meetings sprang up rapidly. The first meeting in London, though not indeed planted by him, was the work of his trustiest lieutenant, G. V. Wigram; and the meeting at Rawstorne Street, Camden Town, ultimately became the nucleus of Darby\'is metropolitan system of administration, which will occupy a considerable place in the sequel. Of this, the first transient indication occurs in 1838, when Wigram addressed (evidently to Darby) the following letter :\'o35 \`iMY DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER,\'oThere is a matter exercising the minds of some of us at this present time in which you may be (and in some sense certainly are) concerned. The question I refer to is, How are meetings for communion of saints in these parts to be regulated? Would it be for the glory of the Lord and the increase of testimony to have one central meeting, the common responsibility of all within reach, and as many meetings subordinate to it as grace might vouchsafe? or to hold it to be better to allow the meetings to grow up as they may without connexion and dependent upon the energy of individuals only? . . . truly, provided there be in London some place where the wanderer can find rest and communion, my desire is met; though the glory of the Lord will of course be still to be cared for. \`iI am, dear brother, yours in Jesus, \`iG.

"Fellowship [koinonia] implies a common bond that connects disciples together (with each other and with God Himself) and yields a deep and profound relationship characterised by holiness, unity, and affection - for the accomplishment of God's will and purposes, bringing honour to Him and joy and fulfilment to everyone involved." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYVP62S7?page=1}{p. 4})

\emph{Isn't this a description of what we have achieved through Christ's death? We, on our own, cannot achieve holiness by our own merits. That's impossible. We can strive for excellence but we are only sanctified and made holy (saints) through the work of the cross) (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYVP62S7?page=1}{note on p.4})}

"At a horizontal level between fellow disciples of the Lord Jesus" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYVP62S7?page=1}{p. 4})

\emph{This understanding seems to ignore the context of the passage. The preceding text reveals what was "seen and heard" is the "word of Life" which was made manifest to them (i.e. Christ). Paul is preaching Christ. If they accept his message of eternal life then they have "fellowship" with them, but he clarifies that this isn't refering to the common use of the word - this is talking about a vertical fellowship which they have. If we don't understand it this way, you are creating great difficulties with the following verse.

1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.

If we don't walk in the light, we don't have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus does not cleanse us from all sins. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SYVP62S7?page=1}{note on p.4})}}

"The reference in Acts 2:42 does not refer to 'the Fellowship' (an entity), it refers to 'fellowship', an activity which was to characterise those who having heard the word preached by the apostles, had believed, were baptised, and had been added to the growing number of like-minded people at that time. The activity of 'fellowship' was to sit alongside another three core activities which these first post-Pentecost disciples of the Lord Jesus were to devote themselves to, namely, the apostles teaching, the breaking of the bread and the prayers. I have attached an article (written by yours truly) recently published in Needed Truth that hopefully helps with the understanding of what the act of 'fellowship' involves (note that this is a draft and differs a bit from what was finally published)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8N7F5WX?page=1}{p. 1})

"The term 'the Fellowship' as used to describe the entity that comprises all churches of God around the world, is a scriptural term, however, Acts 2:42 is not a reference that helps our understanding of this concept; 1 Corinthians 1:9 is a key reference for this." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8N7F5WX?page=1}{p. 1})

"So we see two distinct expressions involving fellowship, one is an activity (Acts 2:42), the other is an entity (1 Cor 1:9)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8N7F5WX?page=2}{p. 2})

\emph{On your understanding of Acts 2:42. This is interesting as this hasn't been the historical Needed Truth writer's understandings over the last 125 years (see needed truths from 1892 [@luxemoore1892], 1954 [@stoope1954] \& 1981  which all state that the use of 'fellowship in both 1 Cor 1:9 \& Acts 2:42 is refering to the collective 'entity'). The earliest article I've found to align with your view would be G. Neely's article in the 2002 Needed Truth. \{\% cite neelyg2002 \%\}

This seems to be a development on a proof text which supports a key principle in Churches of God thinking.   which the writer states that both 1 Cor 1:9 \& Acts 2:42 are both proof texts for the concept of 'The Fellowship' (entity).

From a brief survey of needed truth articles over the last 125 years, the pattern seems to have moved from understanding the use of fellowship in Acts 2:42 was an 'entity' (e.g. Needed Truths from 1892, 1954 \& 1981) to agreeing that this was infact describing an 'activity' (e.g. G.Neely, Needed Truth 2002). The later I would agree with.

They would all agree with you that the key text for understanding 'The Fellowship' as an 'entity' is found in 1 Cor 1:9 has consistently maintained its position as the key verse though all the needed truth writings ive read when supporting the understanding of "the Fellowship" as an entity. However, I feel they have neglected to consider the direct parallel in 1Jn1? I guess bible translators would agree with that line of thought considering the overwhelming majority of them remove "the" to make the parallel with 1Jn 1 clearer. The use of the definite article can easily be explained but pointing out there is only one Christ, so in joining with him, we are all joining the same fellowship.

Additionally, in the context of the passage (1Cor 1:1-9 ) is a thanksgiving to God for the work He has done through Christ. He describes his recipients as: (a) sanctified in Jesus Christ; (b) called to be saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours; (c) possessing the grace of God; (d) will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ; (e) being strengthened\ldots{}till the end and; (f) called into [the] fellowship with[of] his son.

These are attributes gifted by God that all granted by the work on the cross, and gifted when each individual had been called to accept this truth. Understanding the final statement as called into fellowship with his son as a further we are called into the universal church (the body of Christ). This sticks with the whole theme the opening passage (if not the whole theme of the scriptures!) and again I believe this is quite obvious.

The earliest article I've found to align with your view would be G. Neely's article in the 2002 Needed Truth. \{\% cite neelyg2002 \%\}

This seems to be a development on a proof text which supports a key principle in Churches of God thinking. which the writer states that both 1 Cor 1:9 \& Acts 2:42 are both proof texts for the concept of 'The Fellowship' (entity).

From a brief survey of needed truth articles over the last 125 years, the pattern seems to have moved from understanding the use of fellowship in Acts 2:42 was an 'entity' (e.g. Needed Truths from 1892, 1954 \& 1981) to agreeing that this was infact describing an 'activity' (e.g. G.Neely, Needed Truth 2002). The later I would agree with.

They would all agree with you that the key text for understanding 'The Fellowship' as an 'entity' is found in 1 Cor 1:9 has consistently maintained its position as the key verse though all the needed truth writings ive read when supporting the understanding of "the Fellowship" as an entity. However, I feel they have neglected to consider the direct parallel in 1Jn1? I guess bible translators would agree with that line of thought considering the overwhelming majority of them remove "the" to make the parallel with 1Jn 1 clearer. The use of the definite article can easily be explained but pointing out there is only one Christ, so in joining with him, we are all joining the same fellowship.

Additionally, in the context of the passage (1Cor 1:1-9 ) is a thanksgiving to God for the work He has done through Christ. He describes his recipients as: (a) sanctified in Jesus Christ; (b) called to be saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours; (c) possessing the grace of God; (d) will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ; (e) being strengthened\ldots{}till the end and; (f) called into [the] fellowship with[of] his son.

These are attributes gifted by God that all granted by the work on the cross, and gifted when each individual had been called to accept this truth. Understanding the final statement as called into fellowship with his son as a further we are called into the universal church (the body of Christ). This sticks with the whole theme the opening passage (if not the whole theme of the scriptures!) and again I believe this is quite obvious.
