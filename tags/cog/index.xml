      <description>“Two ministers were talking one to another one time and one was trying to be charitable and said, ‘You know, we both serve God. You in your way and I in His.’” — Douglas Wilson
 What i’ve learned over the last few years is this - name calling doesn’t win anyone. I got banned recently for calling a group “elitists” for holding views I didnt hold. Don’t get me wrong, I was right, but there was no profit in name calling.</description>

Bad Faith - Ken Follett (ex-CoG movement turned athiest)

  The Fellowship paid much more attention to the petty rules of Paul than to the open-hearted wisdom of Jesus.
  At the age of fifteen, Dad went to a meeting of the Open Brethren.</description>
