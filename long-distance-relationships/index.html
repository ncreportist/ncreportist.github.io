      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>We both know each other’s schedules and have set our expectations accordingly</strong></li>
<li><strong>We trust each other</strong></li>
<li><strong>We found a way to “hang out” remotely</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule (1-2) phone calls a week via skype at specific times. If one can make it, rearange for another night that week.
<ul>
<li><strong>Decide</strong> a time to have a long, uninterrupted/non-distracted chat (find a pub/coffee shop if house is full). This will work as a booster and will help you cherish each other’s choices and delights. I feel insecure if I find out there is more than one other person at the otherside and will be less trusting/open in my conversation.</li>
<li>Provides feeling of security to both parties</li>
<li>The onus is on the party who cancelled to set the new time</li>
<li>All other conversations (whatsapp/other phone calls) have no pressure to respond</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of resentment of feeling like the other party has no time to speak when <strong>you</strong> want to speak</li>
<li>We like each other because we both pursue interesting lives. If our communications get in the way of out daily lives then we will have little interesting stuff to say!
<ul>
<li>We like each other for our individual interests and passions - nursing, church, bible study, family, friends, career. I want you to be 100% present when your engaged in them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduce the frequency to 1 time a week if it is distrupting life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both be 100% open. If there is something on our mind, don’t keep it in to conserve the other persons feelings. Harder in the short term, but better in the long run.
<ul>
<li>If you dont like something I said, tell me.</li>
<li>Dont lie. If we accidentally lie, don’t feel bad about confessing and correcting yourself. E.g. I will sometimes over exaggerate a story to make is seem more interesting that it is (you have 47 sisters right??)</li>
<li>Never use the silent treatment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When not in our schedules phone call, life is more important (unless something important comes up). If a text takes 2 days to respond to, either party should ne feel resentment.</li>
<li>Do house work while in conversation</li>
<li>Send postcards / letters</li>
<li>Go dating
<ul>
<li>Start a 2 person book club</li>
<li>watch a series</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>never go more than six weeks without seeing one another in person</strong></li>
<li>Call and text each other during the day
<ul>
<li>This wont be possible with my workload. I would sometime turn my phone on airplan mode so I can focus on my work/study/friends.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
